            <h3>7. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
            <p>
              7.1 RAPYD requires user profile information to provide its
              services, and retains such information for as long you maintain
              your Company account.
            </p>
            <p>
              7.2 We retain certain information, including transaction,
              location, device, and usage information, for a minimum of 7 years
              in connection with regulatory, tax, insurance and other
              requirements in the places in which it operates. Once such
              information is no longer necessary to provide our Services, enable
              customer support, enhance the user experience or other operational
              purposes, we will take steps to prevent access to or use of such
              information for any purpose other than compliance with these
              requirements or purposes of safety, security and fraud prevention
              and detection.
            </p>
            <p>
              7.3 We may also retain certain information if necessary for its
              legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and
              enhancing users' safety and security. For example, if we shut down
              a user's account because of unsafe behaviour or security
              incidents, we may retain certain information about that account to
              prevent that user from opening a new one in the future.
            </p>

            <p>

              certain circumstances, we may be unable to delete your account,
              such as if there is an outstanding credit on your account or an
              unresolved claim or dispute. Upon resolution of the issue
              preventing deletion, we will delete your account as described
              above.

              11.1 We provide means for you to see and control the information
              that we collect including through:
              <br /> 11.1.1 Privacy Settings The Privacy Settings menu in the
              RAPYD rider app gives users the ability to set or update their
              location and contacts sharing preferences, and their preferences
              for receiving mobile notifications from RAPYD. Information on
              these settings, how to set or change these settings, and the
              effect of turning off these settings are described below.
            </p>
            <p>(a). Location Information</p>
            <p>
              We use rider's device location services to make it easier to get a
              safe, reliable ride whenever you need one. Location data helps
              improve our services, including pickups, navigation, and customer
              support. You may enable/disable, or adjust, our collection of
              rider location information at any time through the Privacy
              Settings menu in the RAPYD app, or via the settings on your mobile
              device. If you disable the device location services on your
              device, your use of the RAPYD app will be affected. For example,
              you will need to manually enter your pick-up or drop-off
              locations. In addition, location information will be collected
              from the driver during your trip and linked to your account, even
              if you have not enabled The Company to collect your location
              information.
            </p>
            <p>(b). Share Live Location (Riders)</p>
            <p>
              We use the rider's device location services to make it easier to
              get a safe, reliable ride whenever you need one. Location data
              helps improve our services, including pickups, navigation, and

              collection of rider location information at any time through the
              Privacy Settings menu in the Company app, or via the settings on
              your mobile device. If you disable the device location services on
              your device, your use of the RAPYD app will be affected. For
              example, you will need to manually enter your pick-up or drop-off

            <p>
              If you have enabled the device location services on your mobile
              device, you may also enable us to share your location with your
              driver from the time you request a ride to the start of your trip.
              This makes it easier for your driver to pick you up. You may
              enable/disable location sharing with your driver at any time
              through the Privacy Settings menu in the Company app. You may use
              the Company app if you have not enabled location sharing, but it
              may be more difficult for your driver to locate you.
            </p>
            <p>(d). Notifications: Account and Trip Updates</p>
            <p>
              We provide users with trip status notifications and updates
              related to their accounts. These notifications are a necessary
              part of using the RAPYD app, and cannot be disabled. However, you
              may choose the method by which you receive these notifications
              through the Privacy Settings menu in the RAPYD app.

              11.1.2 DEVICE PERMISSIONS Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android,
              etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot
              access without your consent and these platforms have different
              permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform
              will alert you the first time the RAPYD app wants permission to
              access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not
              consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the
              permissions that the RAPYD app seeks before you first use the app,
              and your use of the app constitutes your consent.
            </p>
            <h3>12. Updates to this Policy</h3>
            <p>
              We may occasionally update this policy. If we make significant
              changes, we will notify you of the changes through the RAPYD apps
              or by posting updates on our website, or through others means,

              to this policy. We encourage you to periodically review this
              policy for the latest information on our privacy practices. We may
